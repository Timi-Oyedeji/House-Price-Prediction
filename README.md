# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for predicting house prices using machine learning regression models. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling using techniques such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest Regression. The notebook is designed for ease of understanding and can be used as a foundation for similar predictive modeling tasks.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares the data for machine learning.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations include correlation heatmaps and bar plots to understand the data.
**Machine Learning Models:** Implements multiple regression models and compares their performance.
**Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate models.
**Reproducible Workflow:** Provides clear and annotated steps, making it accessible for new learners and professionals alike.

## Technologies Used
**Python Libraries:**
   “`pandas`” For data manipulation.
    matplotlib & seaborn: For visualizing data.
    scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For an interactive coding environment.
