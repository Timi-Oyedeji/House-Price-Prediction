# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for predicting house prices using machine learning regression models. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling using techniques such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest Regression. The notebook is designed for ease of understanding and can be used as a foundation for similar predictive modeling tasks.

## Technologies Used
**Python Libraries:**
  * `pandas` For data manipulation.

   `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For visualizing data.
    
   `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For an interactive coding environment.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features related to house characteristics and the target variable, SalePrice.
